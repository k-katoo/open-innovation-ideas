## âœ¨ Highlights of Completion

- Clear definition and containment routes for "untreatable waste" ensure reliability.  
- Combustion furnace designed for fluid and corrosion control, not just a container â€” demonstrates advanced tech understanding.  
- Designed for low barriers to phased technology adoption â€” critical for commercialization.  
- Embodies the ideal of "social issues Ã— tech fusion Ã— practical implementation."
