LCB: Layered Coordinate Bitstream for AI Applications

Description:
Layered Coordinate Bitstream (LCB) is a unified, lightweight data format for AI. It allows multiple sensor inputs to be transformed into a standard bitstream suitable for inference across domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, language processing, surveillance, measurement, and environmental monitoring.

Highlights:

Unified layer-based bitstream (LCB)
Lightweight and compressed for edge devices
Selective layer transmission (Layer Mask)
Tamper-proof with hash chaining & ECDSA
Multi-domain templates: language, autonomous driving, healthcare, measurement
Open standard, extensible, and privacy-conscious

Usage:
AI developers can adopt LCB for rapid cross-domain integration
Supports offline and real-time edge inference
Compatible with Python/C++ implementations
