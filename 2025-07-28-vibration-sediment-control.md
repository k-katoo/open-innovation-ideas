## 🧠 Idea Title

**Sediment Control and Ejection System Using Vibration and Fluidized Layers**

## 🗂 Idea Category

- Infrastructure Maintenance
- Environmental Sediment Management
- Hybrid Tech Design (Vibration × Hydraulics × Modularization)

## 📐 Components

1. Retrofit-capable sediment guide module with vibration
2. Exchangeable underwater parts (abrasion-resilient)
3. Cyclonic muddy water separator (secondary resource usage)
4. Modular multi-unit control system

## 💡 Use Cases

- Retrofit for existing or new dams
- Rural irrigation reservoirs or silt ponds
- Sediment balancing in river systems

## 🧭 Evaluation (5-Axis / 5-Point Scale)

| Axis            | Score | Comment |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Novelty         | 4.0   | Integration of existing methods with rarely tested combination |
| Technical Impact| 4.5   | Extends life of dams with minimal cost – high applicability in Japan |
| Market Value    | 3.5   | High cost-effectiveness vs public investment scale |
| Societal Value  | 4.5   | Reduces environmental impact while enabling sediment reuse |
| Scalability     | 3.5   | Modular approach makes pilot testing feasible |

**Overall: 4.0 / 5.0**

## 🔍 Novelty Discussion Points

- Vibration-based sediment guiding is nearly untested at this scale
- Modular abrasion parts rare in civil hydraulic systems
- Cyclonic sediment processing for reuse is unexplored in dam engineering
